Dogs’ Memory for Toy Names Surprises Researchers: Insights from a New Study

September 10, 2024 News & Cause 37

During the 15,000 years of being domesticated, dogs’ memory has evolved to resemble humans in astonishing ways, showing unexpected parallels between the two animals. Humans and dogs alike have the ability to comprehend and react to emotions, even facial expressions. Both have a deep understanding of body language and vocalization for communication purposes. They even age similarly, experiencing physical changes and age-related diseases.

The latest study conducted by Shany Dror at the Eötvös Loránd University has added a new chapter to this fascinating journey of resemblance. In this research, Hungarian scientists found that some dogs can remember the names of toys even after two long years. They explored how dogs store object names in long-term memory. 

The ability to remember newly learned words is crucial to young children’s vocabulary development. While previous studies have highlighted the impressive skills of specific dogs, such as Chaser, the border collie who learned over 1,000 object names, this new study goes a step further by demonstrating the lasting nature of this memory. One day, it could even make our dogs capable of understanding and responding more effectively.

The study, led by Shany Dror, involved 5 dogs that had previously learned the names of 12 toys. After two years of no exposure to these toys, the owners reintroduced them and conducted a series of tests to see if their dogs could still recognize the names, and the results were surprising. On average, 44% of dogs remembered the toys with their name, and some even had a success rate as high as 60%, far surpassing what would be expected by chance.

After letting the dogs inspect the toys, the owners placed a mix of test toys and other familiar toys in one room. They then asked their dogs to fetch specific toys by name from another room. The dogs’ responses were recorded and analyzed, revealing that these canines retained the ability to recall the names of several toys, even after two years.

This discovery is not just a testament to canine memory but also has potential implications for understanding human language evolution. Memory is a crucial component of language, and studying how animals like dogs process and store information can provide insights into what makes human language so unique.

However, it’s important to note that not all dogs have this ability. The study found that only a few ‘word learner’ dogs could remember toy names so effectively. \n\nDror suggested that the difference might lie in how much time and engagement the owners invest in their dogs. “The more you invest in your dog, the more you will get back from the relationship,” she explained.\n\nA recent study in Biology Letters explores dogs’ cognitive abilities, specifically their memory of toy names. While the ability to remember toy names itself might seem like a simple trick, it could be part of a more complex cognitive process that has yet to be fully understood.\n\nThis research suggests that dogs may feel nostalgic about their favorite toys from the past, like humans recent research on dog memory showcases not just the remarkable cognitive skills of dogs but also emphasizes the strengthening bond between humans and their canine friends.\n\nDogs’ ability to remember past experiences and be emotionally affected by them mirrors humans’ ability to recall memories and dreams. This mutual ability to recognize and feel deeply emphasizes the connection between humans and their canine companions, providing insight into canine cognition and human-animal relationships.\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\nAuthor Bio\nSubscribe to Our Newsletter\nAuthor Bio\nAbhay’s passion for writing ignited early, leading him to pursue a degree in Journalism.
